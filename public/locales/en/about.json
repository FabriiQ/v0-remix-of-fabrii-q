          "description_1": "For eight years, we've been deeply embedded in the educational technology landscape, working with institutions across different scales and contexts. What started as enthusiasm for \"improving education through technology\" gradually revealed a troubling pattern.",
          "description_2": "We watched institutions struggle with 3-7 different systems that couldn't communicate. Student information lived in one place, learning management in another, financial data in a third, and communication scattered across multiple platforms."

          "title": "The Revelation",
          "description_1": "The breakthrough came when we realized we were asking the wrong question. Instead of \"How can we build a better LMS?\" we should have been asking: \"Why are educational institutions forced to operate like a collection of disconnected departments?\"",
