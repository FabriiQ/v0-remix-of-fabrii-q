            "answer": "FabriiQ is a comprehensive School Operating System, not just an LMS. While traditional LMS platforms focus primarily on course delivery and basic student management, FabriiQ unifies all institutional operations - enrollment management, financial systems, attendance tracking, communications, and advanced learning analytics - into one intelligent platform. We're designed specifically for multi-campus educational institutions with built-in AI agents (AIVY) and Bloom's Taxonomy integration from the ground up, not as add-on features."
          },
          "alpha_phase": {
            "question": "What does \"Alpha Phase\" mean for my institution?",
            "answer": "Alpha Phase means our core systems are operational and being used by development partners, but we're still refining features based on real-world feedback. All essential institutional functions work reliably - enrollment, fee management, attendance, grading, and communications. However, some advanced features are still being optimized. Alpha partners get full platform access, custom configuration, and direct influence over development priorities. We're transparent about what's ready now versus what's coming in Beta phase."
          },
          "partnership_program": {
            "question": "How does the Development Partnership program work?",
            "answer": "Development partners are co-creators, not customers. You get early access to the full platform, custom configuration for your institution's needs, and no upfront licensing costs during the development phase. In exchange, you provide feedback, participate in testing, and help us refine features based on real educational workflows. We limit partnerships to 12 institutions to ensure meaningful collaboration. The partnership includes staff training, data migration support, and ongoing platform evolution based on your institution's growth."
          },
          "ferpa_compliance": {
            "question": "Is FabriiQ compliant with educational privacy regulations like FERPA?",
            "answer": "Yes, FERPA compliance is built into our platform architecture, not added afterward. We use a privacy-by-design approach with automated compliance monitoring, comprehensive audit trails, and AI-powered content classification to identify potential privacy risks. All educational records are protected with appropriate access controls, and we maintain detailed logs of all data access and disclosures as required by FERPA regulations."
          },
          "multi_campus": {
            "question": "Can FabriiQ handle multi-campus institutions with different programs and policies?",
            "answer": "Multi-campus operations are core to FabriiQ's design. We support complex institutional hierarchies (Institution → Campus → Program → Class) with centralized policy management and campus-level implementation flexibility. Each campus can have specific fee structures, academic calendars, and operational procedures while maintaining unified reporting and cross-campus analytics. Our system handles everything from small satellite campuses to large multi-location institutions."
          },
          "aivy_system": {
            "question": "How does the AIVY Multi-Agent System work, and is it safe for educational use?",
            "answer": "AIVY consists of specialized AI agents designed specifically for education: Student Companion Agents for personalized learning support, Teacher Assistant Agents for curriculum help, Content Generation Agents for educational materials, Analytics Agents for insights, and Safety & Compliance Agents for monitoring. All agents operate within strict educational guidelines, maintain student privacy, and include safety mechanisms. Teachers and administrators retain full control over AI recommendations and can override any automated decisions."
          },
          "data_migration": {
            "question": "What happens to our existing data and systems when we implement FabriiQ?",
            "answer": "We provide comprehensive data migration support as part of the development partnership. Our team works with you to map existing data structures, migrate historical records, and ensure continuity of operations. FabriiQ can integrate with many existing systems, and we provide tools for exporting data if needed. During the transition period, we support parallel operations to minimize disruption to your educational processes."
          },
          "long_term_costs": {
            "question": "What are the long-term costs and commitment requirements?",
            "answer": "During the Alpha development partnership phase, there are no licensing fees - the partnership covers initial deployment, customization, and training. Long-term pricing will be announced before Beta phase launch, with development partners receiving significant discounts and grandfathered benefits. The partnership requires dedicated staff time for training and feedback sessions (approximately 4-6 hours per week initially), commitment to the collaborative development process, and willingness to serve as a reference for other educational institutions. We believe in building long-term relationships, not short-term transactions."
